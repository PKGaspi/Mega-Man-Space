# Mega-Man-Space
Source code of my very first game

The game was made in Game Maker Studio 1.4, mostrly using DnD.
To check the code, please download Game Maker Studio 1.4 and open this project as normal.
Please note that I started this project more than a year ago knowing mostly nothing about
programming, so most of the code is complete garbage that somehow works. Thank you.

If what you want is to play the game, please download at http://gaspi.gamejolt.io/MegaManSpace
